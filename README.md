# StackBlitz Enterprise Terraform

This repository contains Terraform for provisioning StackBlitz resources on popular infrastructure management platforms. AWS and Azure are currently supported with more to come.


# Getting Started
1. Choose your infrastructure platform and navigate to the corresponding directory
2. create a `terraform.tfvars` file and define variables as documented in `variables.tf`
3. ensure you've properly configured authentication for your infra provider (via it's own cli)
4. run `terrafom apply`
